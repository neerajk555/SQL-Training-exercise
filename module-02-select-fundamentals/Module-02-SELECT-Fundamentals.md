# Module 2: SELECT Fundamentals

Welcome to Module 2! In this module you’ll master core MySQL SELECT skills: choosing columns, filtering with WHERE, sorting with ORDER BY, limiting rows, handling NULL, de-duplicating with DISTINCT, using aliases, simple expressions, and common predicates like IN, BETWEEN, LIKE.

What you’ll practice
- Reading data with SELECT ... FROM
- Filtering: WHERE with AND/OR/NOT, comparison operators, LIKE, IN, BETWEEN, IS [NOT] NULL
- Sorting and paging: ORDER BY, LIMIT/OFFSET
- Shaping results: column aliases, expressions, CONCAT, COALESCE, DISTINCT
- Basic data hygiene: trimming, case-insensitive searches with LOWER/UPPER

How to use this module
- Start with Quick Warm-Ups, then do Guided Step-by-Step.
- Try Independent Practice and the Paired Programming activity.
- Attempt the Real-World Project when you’re comfortable.
- Use Error Detective and Speed Drills for reinforcement.
- Take-Home Challenges are for deeper, open-ended practice.

Conventions
- MySQL syntax only. Use backticks for identifiers when needed (e.g., reserved words or spaces).
- Each activity provides sample data you can copy-paste into a scratch database.
- Edge cases are included (NULLs, duplicates, empty results).
- Time estimates are suggestions—take what you need.

Tip: For performance on large tables, filter early with WHERE on indexed columns, avoid functions on the left side of predicates when possible, and only SELECT the columns you need.
