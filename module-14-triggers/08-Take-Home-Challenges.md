## Challenge 5: Conflict Resolution (2-3 hours)

### 📋 Objective
Handle scenarios where multiple triggers fire simultaneously and ensure correct execution order using trigger naming conventions and design patterns.

### 📝 Scenarios to Handle

1. **Multiple BEFORE triggers on same table**
   - Validation trigger
   - Default value trigger
   - Calculated field trigger
   - How to ensure they execute in correct order?

2. **Cascading updates across tables**
   - Order placed → Update inventory
   - Update inventory → Create alert
   - Create alert → Send notification
   - Prevent infinite loops!

3. **Concurrent trigger execution**
   - Two users update same product simultaneously
   - Both trigger stock alerts
   - Prevent duplicate alerts

4. **Transaction boundaries**
   - Multiple operations in one transaction
   - Some triggers succeed, some fail
   - Ensure consistency

### 💡 Implementation Strategies

**Strategy 1: Naming Convention**
```sql
-- Use prefixes to control order (alphabetical execution)
CREATE TRIGGER tr_01_validate ...
CREATE TRIGGER tr_02_calculate ...
CREATE TRIGGER tr_03_audit ...
```

**Strategy 2: Coordinator Trigger**
```sql
-- Single trigger calls stored procedures in order
CREATE TRIGGER tr_coordinator ...
BEGIN
  CALL validate_data(NEW.id);
  CALL calculate_fields(NEW.id);
  CALL audit_changes(NEW.id);
END;
```

**Strategy 3: Flag Columns**
```sql
-- Prevent re-triggering
ALTER TABLE my_table ADD processing BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

CREATE TRIGGER tr_example ...
BEGIN
  IF NEW.processing = FALSE THEN
    SET NEW.processing = TRUE;
    -- Do work
    SET NEW.processing = FALSE;
  END IF;
END;
```

## Challenge 7: Transaction-Safe Triggers (2-3 hours)

### 📋 Objective
Ensure triggers work correctly with transactions, including proper COMMIT and ROLLBACK behavior.

### 📝 Requirements

**Part 1: Transaction Behavior Study**
Test and document:
```sql
-- Scenario 1: Successful transaction
START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, total) VALUES (1, 100);
-- Trigger fires, updates inventory
COMMIT;
-- Both order and inventory update saved

-- Scenario 2: Rolled back transaction
START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, total) VALUES (1, 100);
-- Trigger fires, updates inventory
ROLLBACK;
-- Both order and inventory update rolled back

-- Scenario 3: Trigger error
START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, total) VALUES (1, 100);
-- Trigger fires, raises error
-- Transaction automatically rolled back

-- Scenario 4: Nested transactions (savepoints)
START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO orders VALUES (1, 100);
SAVEPOINT sp1;
INSERT INTO orders VALUES (2, 200);  -- This might trigger error
ROLLBACK TO sp1;  -- Only rollback second insert
COMMIT;  -- First insert and its trigger effects saved
```

**Part 2: Build Transaction-Safe Triggers**
Create triggers that:
- Handle partial failures gracefully
- Use SAVEPOINT when needed
- Implement compensating transactions
- Log transaction boundaries
