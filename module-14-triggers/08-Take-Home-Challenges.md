# Take-Home Challenges — Triggers

## Challenge 1: Trigger Performance Analysis
Measure performance impact of triggers on bulk operations. Compare with/without triggers.

## Challenge 2: Temporal Data System
Implement complete history tracking: every change to every table captured with triggers.

## Challenge 3: Business Rule Engine
Encode complex business rules in triggers: discount calculations, eligibility checks, workflow automation.

## Challenge 4: Trigger Debugging Strategy
Build logging system to debug trigger execution order and data flow.

## Challenge 5: Conflict Resolution
Handle scenarios where multiple triggers fire simultaneously. Ensure correct execution order.

## Challenge 6: Trigger vs Application Logic
Document when to use triggers vs application code. Create decision flowchart.

## Challenge 7: Rollback-Safe Triggers
Ensure triggers work correctly with transactions. Test COMMIT/ROLLBACK scenarios.
