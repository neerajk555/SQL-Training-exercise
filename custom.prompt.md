SQL Practice Activities Prompt for GitHub Copilot
Create hands-on practice activities for SQL training with recent college graduates. All exercises use MySQL syntax.
Required Activity Types:
1. Quick Warm-Ups (5 exercises, 5-10 min each)
Each includes: title, one-sentence scenario, sample data (3-5 rows), specific task, expected output, time estimate.
2. Guided Step-by-Step (3 activities, 15-20 min each)
Each includes: business context, database setup (CREATE/INSERT), final goal, 4-step instructions with checkpoints, common mistakes list, complete solution with comments, 2-3 discussion questions.
3. Independent Practice (7 exercises: 3 easy, 3 medium, 1 challenge)
Each includes: difficulty badge ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”´, time estimate, scenario, schema with sample data (10-20 rows), requirements list, example output, success criteria, 3-level hints, detailed solution with alternatives.
4. Paired Programming (1 activity, 30 min)
Includes: driver/navigator roles, 2-4 table schema, three progressive parts (A/B/C), role-switching points, collaboration tips, solutions.
5. Real-World Project (1 project, 45-60 min)
Includes: company background, business problem, 4-6 table database with 30+ rows, 3-5 deliverables with acceptance criteria, bonus objectives, evaluation rubric, model solution.
6. Error Detective (5 challenges)
Each includes: scenario, broken MySQL query with bugs, error message, sample data, expected output, guiding questions, solution explanation.
7. Speed Drills (10 questions, 2-3 min each)
Mix of: syntax writing, error spotting, clause selection, fill-in-blanks, true/false. Include immediate answers for self-scoring.
8. Take-Home Challenges (3 advanced exercises)
Each includes: multi-part problem (3-4 related queries), realistic dataset, open-ended component, detailed solutions with trade-offs.
Guidelines:

Use relatable domains (e-commerce, education, healthcare)
Include edge cases (NULLs, duplicates, empty results)
MySQL syntax only with backticks where needed
Progressive difficulty from warm-ups to challenges
All solutions tested and commented
Add performance notes for larger datasets
Include encouragement and time estimates
