# Take-Home Challenges — Procedures & Functions

## Challenge 1: Cursor Implementation
Create procedure using cursor to iterate through records and perform calculations.

## Challenge 2: Dynamic SQL
Build procedure that generates and executes dynamic queries based on parameters.

## Challenge 3: Error Handling with DECLARE HANDLER
Implement comprehensive error handling: CONTINUE, EXIT handlers for different scenarios.

## Challenge 4: Recursive Procedure
Create procedure to traverse hierarchical data (e.g., organizational chart).

## Challenge 5: Audit Logging System
Build procedure that automatically logs all parameters and execution results.

## Challenge 6: Batch Processing
Create procedure for batch operations with progress tracking and rollback capabilities.

## Challenge 7: Function Library
Build reusable function library: string manipulation, date calculations, business rules.

**Research:** Cursors, dynamic SQL, handlers, prepared statements, recursion limits
