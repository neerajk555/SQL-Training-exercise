This folder contains complete MySQL practice activities for aggregates and grouping. All tasks include copy-paste sample data and commented solutions.

What’s inside
- Quick Warm-Ups (5): Small datasets to quickly try common aggregates
- Guided Step-by-Step (3): Structured scenarios using GROUP BY and HAVING
- Independent Practice (7): Easy → Medium → Challenge with solutions
- Paired Programming (1): Collaborative summarization exercises
- Real-World Project (1): Multi-table dataset and practical deliverables
- Error Detective (5): Fix common grouping and aggregate mistakes
- Speed Drills (10): Short Q&A with immediate answers
- Take-Home Challenges (3): Multi-part, open-ended aggregate problems

How to start
1) Create a scratch MySQL database.
2) For each activity, run the provided CREATE/INSERT blocks.
3) Attempt the tasks and compare with the commented solutions.

Notes
- MySQL 8.0+ friendly; `GROUP_CONCAT` used for list aggregation.
- Edge cases include NULLs, duplicates, and empty-result groups.

Encouragement: Summaries tell the story—filter carefully, group thoughtfully, and validate totals.
