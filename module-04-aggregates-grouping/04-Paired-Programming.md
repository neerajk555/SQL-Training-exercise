# Paired Programming: Ops Dash Summaries (30 min)

**Beginner Tip:** Collaboration strengthens learning! Talk through your logic as driverâ€”explaining helps you think clearly. As navigator, ask "what if?" questions to explore edge cases. Both roles teach different skills. Be patient and encouraging!

Roles
- Driver: Writes SQL, narrates choices.
- Navigator: Reviews logic, checks requirements, suggests edge cases.
- Switch roles after each part.

Schema (3 tables)
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS pp4_customers;
CREATE TABLE pp4_customers (
  customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  city VARCHAR(40)
);
INSERT INTO pp4_customers VALUES
(1,'Austin'),(2,'Dallas'),(3,'Austin'),(4,NULL),(5,'Seattle');

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS pp4_orders;
CREATE TABLE pp4_orders (
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INT,
  order_date DATE,
  status VARCHAR(20)
);
INSERT INTO pp4_orders VALUES
(101,1,'2025-03-01','shipped'),(102,1,'2025-03-02','processing'),(103,2,'2025-03-05','shipped'),
(104,3,'2025-03-05','cancelled'),(105,5,'2025-03-07','processing');

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS pp4_order_items;
CREATE TABLE pp4_order_items (
  order_item_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id INT,
  qty INT,
  price DECIMAL(7,2)
);
INSERT INTO pp4_order_items VALUES
(1,101,2,12.00),(2,101,1,7.99),(3,102,1,18.00),(4,103,3,4.99),(5,104,2,3.75),(6,105,NULL,15.00);
```

Part A (Driver 1): Orders per Status
- Task: List `status`, `COUNT(*)` as `cnt` ordered desc.
- Solution
```sql
SELECT status, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM pp4_orders
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY cnt DESC, status;
```

Part B (Driver 2): Revenue by Order
- Task: For each order, compute `revenue = SUM(qty*price)` (NULL-safe) and show `order_id`, `revenue` ordered desc.
- Solution
```sql
SELECT order_id,
       SUM(COALESCE(qty,0) * price) AS revenue
FROM pp4_order_items
GROUP BY order_id
ORDER BY revenue DESC;
```

Part C (Driver 1): City-level Order Counts (customers with NULL city grouped as 'Unknown')
- Task: Show `city_label` and `orders_cnt` grouped by city from customers who placed orders.
- Solution
```sql
SELECT COALESCE(c.city,'Unknown') AS city_label,
       COUNT(*) AS orders_cnt
FROM pp4_orders o
JOIN pp4_customers c ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY COALESCE(c.city,'Unknown')
ORDER BY orders_cnt DESC, city_label;
```

Role-switching points
- Switch after each part; Navigator summarizes validation steps.

Collaboration tips
- Navigator: Ask "Do we need WHERE or HAVING? Any NULLs to normalize?"
- Driver: Narrate: "Group by key, compute aggregate, then sort and label."
