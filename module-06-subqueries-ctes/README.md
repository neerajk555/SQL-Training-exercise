# Module 06 Â· Subqueries & CTEs

Welcome to Module 06: Subqueries & CTEs. Youâ€™ll learn scalar, row, and table subqueries; correlated vs non-correlated patterns; EXISTS/NOT EXISTS vs IN/NOT IN; derived tables; CTEs for readability; and recursive CTEs for hierarchies and sequences.

- **05-Real-World-Project.md** â€” 1 realistic analytics project (45-60 min)
- **06-Error-Detective.md** â€” 5 debugging challenges
- **07-Speed-Drills.md** â€” 10 quick questions (2-3 min each) with answers
- **08-Take-Home-Challenges.md** â€” 3 advanced multi-part scenarios

## How to use
- MySQL 8.0+ required (CTEs and recursive CTEs supported). Alternatives suggested where helpful.
- All activities are self-contained and include setup (CREATE/INSERT).
- Time estimates are guidesâ€”work at your own pace!

## Tips for success
- Prefer EXISTS/NOT EXISTS for semi/anti-joins, especially with NULLs.
- Use derived tables or CTEs to stage complex logic, then filter/order outside.
- With recursive CTEs, always include a clear termination condition.

**Encouragement:** Subqueries and CTEs break complex problems into manageable pieces. Test each part separatelyâ€”you've got this! ðŸš€
