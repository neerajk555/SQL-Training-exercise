# Module 06: Subqueries & CTEs

Learning goals
- Write scalar, row, and table subqueries (in SELECT, WHERE, FROM)
- Use EXISTS/NOT EXISTS and understand IN/NOT IN with NULL semantics
- Build correlated subqueries safely and efficiently
- Use derived tables and CTEs to organize multi-step logic
- Create recursive CTEs for hierarchies and sequences

What you’ll practice
- E-commerce, education, and healthcare scenarios
- Filtering with semi/anti-joins, top-N per group via subqueries, rolling up with CTEs

Assessment
- Warm-ups and drills for retrieval
- Guided and independent practice for skill-building
- Take-home challenges and a project for synthesis

Estimated time: 3–4 hours total
