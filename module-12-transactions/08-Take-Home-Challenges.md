# Take-Home Challenges — Transactions

## Challenge 1: Saga Pattern Implementation
Research compensating transactions for microservices. Implement order cancellation with refunds.

## Challenge 2: Optimistic Locking
Implement versioning strategy: add `version` column, check before update, handle conflicts.

## Challenge 3: Transaction Retry Logic
Write application code to retry transactions on deadlock. Exponential backoff strategy.

## Challenge 4: Read Phenomena Analysis
Test and document: Dirty Read, Non-Repeatable Read, Phantom Read at different isolation levels.

## Challenge 5: Long-Running Transaction Optimization
Design strategy for batch processing with periodic commits to avoid locking everything.

## Challenge 6: Two-Phase Commit
Research XA transactions for distributed systems. When to use, when to avoid?

## Challenge 7: Transaction Performance
Measure performance impact of different isolation levels. Balance consistency vs throughput.

**Research:** ACID properties, MVCC, transaction logs, isolation levels, concurrency control
