# Module 05 Â· Joins

Welcome to Module 05: Joins. Youâ€™ll learn to combine data across tables with INNER/LEFT/RIGHT/CROSS joins, self-joins, and patterns like anti-joins (LEFT ... IS NULL) and semi-joins (EXISTS). Youâ€™ll also tackle many-to-many relationships, ON vs WHERE nuances with outer joins, and aggregation after joins.

## How to use
- MySQL 8.0+ recommended; alternatives provided when relevant.
- All activities are self-contained: each includes the CREATE/INSERT setup it needs.
- Time estimates are guidesâ€”take what you need to understand the concepts!

## Tips for success
- Prefer explicit JOIN ... ON syntax.
- Put row-reduction predicates in ON when preserving unmatched rows with LEFT JOIN; otherwise use WHERE.
- Beware of duplicate rows with many-to-many joins; aggregate appropriately.

**Encouragement:** Joins unlock the power of relational databases! Start with INNER JOIN, then explore LEFT JOIN. You've got this! ðŸš€
