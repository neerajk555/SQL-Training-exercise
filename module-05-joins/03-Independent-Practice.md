# Independent Practice â€” Joins (7 exercises)

Includes 3 easy, 3 medium, and 1 challenge. Each exercise has a time estimate, scenario, schema with data, requirements, example output, success criteria, tiered hints, and a detailed solution with alternatives.

**Beginner Tip:** Joins combine multiple tables. Start with Easy exercises to build confidence with INNER and LEFT joins. Check row counts after each join to verify it's working correctly. If you get more rows than expected, you might have a many-to-many relationship. Use hints progressively when stuck!

## Challenge ðŸ”´ (25â€“30 min)

### C1) Marketplace Analytics (many-to-many)
Scenario: A marketplace has sellers and products; orders contain multiple products. Compute key metrics.

Schema and sample data (â‰ˆ18 rows)
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ip5_c_sellers;
CREATE TABLE ip5_c_sellers (seller_id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(60));
INSERT INTO ip5_c_sellers VALUES (1,'Shop A'),(2,'Shop B'),(3,'Shop C');

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ip5_c_products;
CREATE TABLE ip5_c_products (product_id INT PRIMARY KEY, seller_id INT, name VARCHAR(60), price DECIMAL(7,2));
INSERT INTO ip5_c_products VALUES
(1,1,'Notebook',4.99),(2,1,'Pen',2.50),(3,2,'Lamp',12.00),(4,2,'LED Strip',22.00),(5,3,'Mug',7.99);

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ip5_c_orders;
CREATE TABLE ip5_c_orders (order_id INT PRIMARY KEY, order_date DATE);
INSERT INTO ip5_c_orders VALUES (1001,'2025-03-01'),(1002,'2025-03-02'),(1003,'2025-03-03');

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ip5_c_order_items;
CREATE TABLE ip5_c_order_items (order_item_id INT PRIMARY KEY, order_id INT, product_id INT, qty INT);
INSERT INTO ip5_c_order_items VALUES
(1,1001,1,2),(2,1001,5,1),(3,1002,3,1),(4,1002,4,1),(5,1003,2,3),(6,1003,1,1);
```
Requirements
- A) Revenue by seller (sum of qty*price).
- B) Top product by revenue per seller (1 row per seller).
- C) Sellers with no sales (if any) should appear with revenue 0 in part A.

Example outputs (abridged)
```
seller  | revenue
Shop A  | 15.97
Shop B  | 34.00
Shop C  | 7.99
```
Success criteria
- Handle many-to-many multiplicative effects.
- Use window function or anti-join for top-per-group.

Hints
- L1: Join itemsâ†’products, then group by seller.
- L2: For top per group, use ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY seller ORDER BY revenue DESC).
- L3: For sellers with no sales, LEFT JOIN from sellers.

Solution
```sql
-- A) Revenue by seller (include zero)
SELECT s.name AS seller,
       COALESCE(SUM(oi.qty * p.price),0) AS revenue
FROM ip5_c_sellers s
LEFT JOIN ip5_c_products p ON p.seller_id = s.seller_id
LEFT JOIN ip5_c_order_items oi ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY s.name
ORDER BY revenue DESC, s.name;

-- B) Top product by revenue per seller
WITH seller_product AS (
  SELECT s.name AS seller, p.name AS product,
         SUM(oi.qty * p.price) AS revenue,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY s.seller_id ORDER BY SUM(oi.qty * p.price) DESC) AS rn
  FROM ip5_c_sellers s
  JOIN ip5_c_products p ON p.seller_id = s.seller_id
  LEFT JOIN ip5_c_order_items oi ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
  GROUP BY s.seller_id, s.name, p.name
)
SELECT seller, product, revenue
FROM seller_product
WHERE rn = 1
ORDER BY seller;
```

Alternatives
- Pre-aggregate order_items by product first to reduce row explosion before joining to sellers.
